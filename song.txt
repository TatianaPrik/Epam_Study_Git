My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
 
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
 
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
